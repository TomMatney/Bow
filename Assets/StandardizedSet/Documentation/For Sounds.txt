Thank you for buying my asset :) 

Read the document or watch my tutorials to have a smoother experience. 

Have a good day. Hope it helps your project.

I placed some of the OnHit sound effects that I am using in my game in the Sounds folder as a gift :)

Use them however you like in your own projects.

But I don't have any bow sounds of my own currently, so you might want to check:

These are the sounds that I used in tutorial and their license is Attribution 3.0 .

It is not necessary but any act of generosity as a support would be appreciated :)
